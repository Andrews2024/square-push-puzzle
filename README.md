# Project Description
This project was completed as an individual assignment for Worcester Polytechnic Institute's CS 3733: Software Engineering class. The project is a web application game where the character Ninja-se pushes blocks around the puzzle to make 2 x 2 squares of each color. As the player moves colors into complete squares, they can remove them to clear up the board. Once all of the colors have been removed, the player can complete the game. While the colored blocks can loop around the board, Ninja-se cannot. The game has three configurations: 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6.

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the application, you will need Node.js installed as a runtime environment and React. Once these are installed, in the project directory, run the command `npm install -g create-react-app` to install React for the project. You can then run the game in your browser by running the following command: `npm start`.
